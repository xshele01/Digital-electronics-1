2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell driver/s_duty_reg[21]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) pwm/s_duty_reg[21]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell driver/s_duty_reg[21]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) pwm/s_duty_reg[0]/CLR, pwm/s_duty_reg[21]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on pwm_o relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on trig_o[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on trig_o[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
